objective:
Built a full ML workflow using scikit-learn on a synthetic e-commerce style dataset.
Goals:
Classification: Predict if a user will respond to a campaign.
Regression: Estimate how long a user spends on the site.
Data Creation:
Generated 100 samples with features like Age, Gender, Income Level, Visit Frequency, Time on Site, and Product Viewed.
Used NumPy and pandas to create a mock dataset.
Data Preprocessing:
Applied one-hot encoding to categorical columns (Gender, Income_Level, Product_Viewed).
Combined with numeric features using ColumnTransformer, ensuring all inputs are numerical.
Benefits
Reproducible: Same preprocessing and feature selection applied to both train and test data
